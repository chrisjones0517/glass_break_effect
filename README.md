# Glass Break Effect
##### This effect is intended to be used when a user clicks a button or link to a new page or view, and subsequently the appearance of the current page breaking into shards occurs. When the page is reformed, the new view/page should be showing. Since the implementation is rather heavy, it is only recommended on relatively light pages/apps.
